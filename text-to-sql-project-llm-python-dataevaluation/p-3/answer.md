## Problem 3 : Automatically verify and improve the LLM-generated SQL query

Inorder to make this possible, we use the previous approach of structured output from the LLM Instead of direct SQL Query from it. Using the LLm we can generate the response as needed in Problem 2 and get the results. Either we can use this response directly to get the result or use this to test the SQL Query generated by the LLM. If we are using to test the LLM generated SQL Query then we must send the problem 2 fields such as the filtering options and the columns and compare them with the sql query given by LLM using an LLM and make sure all the fields are perfectly specified in the query , else reiterate to generate the query again based on the provided filters an columns. Here the integration with database metadata is important. This can make the system effective. Before this the syntax and sematics of the query are analysed. 

Additional

If the responses length(no. of rows) is more than 10 then we can directly return the table and add some details instead of sending to the LLM. Also testing the whole system with sample tests would make us know the possible error points.
